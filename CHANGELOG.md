# Changelog

## 0.1.1
 - Updated changelog from the mod base template, lol.
 - Added new setting Quota Modifier, which allows you to modify the quota based on the number of players in the lobby.
	- There are 3 potential settings:
	    - None: No modifications will be applied.
		- OnlyScaleUp: Modifications will only be applied when there is more than 6 players.
		- AlwaysScale: Quota will always be scaled based on the number of players in the lobby, resulting in easier quotas when there is less than 6 players.   

## 0.1.0
 - Initial release.
