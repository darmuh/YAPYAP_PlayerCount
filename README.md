# PlayerCount (YAPYAP)

### Modify the player lobby limit to up to 20 players (or down to 2!)

- This is an incredibly simple mod that just modifies the lobby player limit from the default.
- The limit is fully configurable and can both increase the limit up to 20 players or decrease the limit down to 2 players.
- Use at your own risk and remember that increasing this player limit has the potential to introduce unintended bugs.

### Configuration Options

 - ``Max Players`` Set desired maximum number of players

 - ``Quota Modifier`` Allows you to modify the quota based on the number of players in the lobby.
	- None: No modifications will be applied.
	- OnlyScaleUp: Modifications will only be applied when there is more than 6 players.
	- AlwaysScale: Quota will always be scaled based on the number of players in the lobby, resulting in easier quotas when there is less than 6 players.
